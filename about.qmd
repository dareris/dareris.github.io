About this blog

My name is Rishav Khatiwada. I am a graduate Physics student at Virginia Tech. However, this blog post has nothing to do with Physics or my Research but primarily on my first step towards learning the various machine Learning models. It contains different posts each consisting of a Machine learning model with the codes and the data visualizations to analyze the code.
